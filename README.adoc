= Creating asynchronous reactive microservices using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].   

Learn how to use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to implement an application with a reactive architecture.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build reactive microservices using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging. You'll also learn how to send messages between these microservices using Apache Kafka. 

=== What is MicroProfile Reactive Messaging?

Temporal decoupling of services in a microservice-based architecture can be achieved using asynchronous communication. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging provides a way to build systems of microservices advocating responsiveness, location transparency, elasticity, resiliency to failure and temporal decoupling. This helps in enforcing asynchronous message passing between the different parts of the system. See
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_microprofile_reactive_messaging[ MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Specification^] for more information.

=== What is Kafka?

https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka^] is a stream-processing platform that manages communication in distributed systems. Communication is message-oriented, and follows the publish-subscribe model. Kafka allows for real-time stream processing and distributed, replicated storage of streams and messages. Kafka Producer is a client or a program, which produces the message and pushes it to the Topic. Whereas Kafka Consumer is a client or a program, which consumes the published messages from the Producer.

=== What is asynchronous programming?
Imagine asynchronous programming as a restaurant. After you're seated, a waiter takes your order. Then, you must wait a few minutes for your food to be prepared. While your food is being prepared, your waiter may take more orders or serve other tables. After your food is ready, your waiter brings out the food to your table. However, in a synchronous model, the waiter must wait for your food to be prepared before serving any other customers. This method blocks other customers from placing orders or receiving their food.

The OpenLiberty Cafe application is designed with reactive architecture. The application that you'll be working with consists of six microservices : `Kitchen`, `Bar`, `Order`, `ServingWindow`, `Status`, and `OpenLibertyCafe`. It also uses Kafka to enable reactive messaging communication between the Producer and Consumer microservices over the messaging channels.

You'll update the `Kitchen`, `Bar`, `Order`, `ServingWindow`, and `Status` microservices to use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging for message passing. These microservices run on Open Liberty.

image::reactive-messaging-restaurant.png[Reactive restaurant,align="center"]

The `OpenLibertyCafe` microservice is a https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#variation-backends-for-frontends[backends for frontends^] service.
It communicates with the backend microservices on the caller's behalf.

The waiter places a request using the `OpenLibertyCafe` microservice.

The `Order` microservice consumes the request, produces order messages, and sends them to Kafka on the `food` or `beverage` channel depending on the type. 

An order begins with a `NEW` status. The `Kitchen` and `Bar` microservices illustrate how to handle the orders as a real cafe. They consume and process the order and update the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and `READY` consecutively. There’s a sleep operation in between each status to represent the order processing time, and the status updates are reported back to the `Status` microservice via reactive messages on the Kafka.

The `ServingWindow` microservice illustrates when the food and beverages are ready to be served. It consumes the `READY` order from the `Kitchen` and `Bar` microservices. Once the order is served, the waiter can mark the order as `COMPLETED` and the status is sent back to the `Status` microservice as a message.

The `Status` microservice receives status updates and provides queries for the waiter. All the orders are persisted here. Because persisting data is not the focus of this guide, the `Status` microservice simply uses a Map object to store the data.

== Creating a Reactive Messaging application

=== Key Concepts

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging recommends a design to build reactive applications based on the following main concepts:

*Channel*

A channel is a name indicating which source or destination of messages is used. Channels are opaque Strings.

*@Outgoing* 

Outgoing is an annotation indicating that the method feeds a channel. The name of the channel is given as attribute.

*@Incoming*

Incoming is an annotation indicating that the method consumes a channel. The name of the channel is given as attribute.

*Connector*

Reactive messaging uses connectors to attach one end of a channel to other messaging technology and are configured using MicroProfile Config.
Open Liberty includes the `liberty-kafka` connector for sending and receiving messages from an Apache Kafka.

=== Configuring the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging

//File 0
order/microprofile-config.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/order/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

//File 1
bar/microprofile-config.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/bar/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin. Most of the code is already provided for use.

Each of the five microservices `Order`, `Kitchen`, `Bar`, `ServingWindow`, and `Status` contain `microprofile-config.properties`
file, which configures the Kafka connector with the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging channels.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the microprofile-config.properties file.#
`order/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----

The [hotspot=kafkaConfig file=0]`mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property defines the Kafka connector for the Open Liberty runtime. The `Order` microservice uses three Outgoing streams: [hotspot=foodStream file=0]`food`, [hotspot=bevStream file=0]`beverage`, and [hotspot=updateStatus file=0]`updateStatus`. All these streams connect to the connector [hotspot=kafka1 hotspot=kafka2 hotspot=kafka3 file=0]`liberty-kafka`. The [hotspot=topic1 hotspot=topic2 hotspot=topic3 file=0]`topic` property defines the topics in Kafka, which are used to communicate with the `Kitchen`, `Bar`, and `Status`  microservices. The [hotspot=serializer1 hotspot=serializer2 hotspot=serializer3 file=0]`key.serializer` and [hotspot=serializerVal1 hotspot=serializerVal2 hotspot=serializerVal3 file=0]`value.serializer` properties characterize how to serialize the messages. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the microprofile-config.properties file.#
`bar/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----

The [hotspot=kafkaConfig file=1]`mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property defines the Kafka connector for the Open Liberty runtime. The `Bar` microservice uses two Outgoing streams [hotspot=beverageOrderPublish file=1]`beverageOrderPublish` and [hotspot=bevOrderPublishInter file=1]`bevOrderPublishInter`, and one Incoming stream [hotspot=bevOrderConsume file=1]`bevOrderConsume`. All these streams connect to the connector [hotspot=kafka1 hotspot=kafka2 hotspot=kafka3 file=1]`liberty-kafka`. The [hotspot=topic1 hotspot=topic2 hotspot=topic3 file=1]`topic` property defines the topics in Kafka, which are used to communicate with the `ServingWindow` and `Status`  microservices. The [hotspot=serializer1 hotspot=serializer3 file=1]`key.serializer` and [hotspot=serializerVal1 hotspot=serializerVal3 file=1]`value.serializer` properties characterize how to serialize the messages. Similarly [hotspot=deserializer2 file=1]`key.deserializer` and [hotspot=deserializerVal2 file=1]`value.deserializer` properties define how to deserialize the messages. The [hotspot=group file=1]`group.id` defines a unique name for the consumer group. All these properties are required by the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#api[Apache Kafka client API^].

The rest of the microservices use similar `microprofile-config.properties` configuration.

=== Building the Order microservice

The `Order` microservice uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to send messages to `Kitchen` and `Bar` microservices over Kafka.

----
#Replace the `OrderResource` class.#
`order/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/order/OrderResource.java`
----
OrderResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']

[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/order/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

The `Order` microservice creates orders when the [hotspot=postOrder file=0]`POST` request of the endpoint `/orders` is called. The [hotspot=createOrder file=0]`createOrder()` method receives [hotspot=foodOrder file=0]`food` or [hotspot=beverageOrder file=0]`beverage` orders and adds it to the respective [hotspot=fOrderQueue hotspot=bOrderQueue file=0]`LinkedBlockingQueue`. As soon as an Order is added to the Queue, the [hotspot=takeF hotspot=takeB file=0]`take()` method retrieves and removes the orders. The Reactive Messaging implementation generates Reactive Streams for those orders and publishes it to Kafka over [hotspot=OutgoingFood file=0]`@Outgoing("food")` or [hotspot=OutgoingBev file=0]`@Outgoing("beverage")` channels, which we configured previously in the [hotspot file=1]`microprofile-config.properties` [hotspot=foodStream file=1]`food` or [hotspot=bevStream file=1]`beverage` stream.

[source, XML ,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/order/pom.xml[]
----

In order to develop the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging application using Maven, add the [hotspot=reactiveMessaging file=2]`microprofile-reactive-messaging-api` and [hotspot=kafka file=2]`kafka-clients` dependencies to the [hotspot file=2]`pom.xml`

=== Building the other microservices

The `Kitchen`, `Bar`, `ServingWindow`, and `Status` microservices are put together in this section.

*Building the Kitchen microservice*

//Kitchen
[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `KitchenResource` class.#
`kitchen/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/kitchen/KitchenResource.java`
----
KitchenResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/kitchen/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/kitchen/KitchenResource.java[]
----

If the order is an item of food, `Kitchen` service receives an order on the [hotspot=foodOrderConsume file=0]`@Incoming("foodOrderConsume")` channel, processes it in [hotspot=initFoodOrder file=0]`initFoodOrder()` method and sends back an `IN_PROGRESS` status on the [hotspot=foodOrderPublishIntermediate file=0]`@Outgoing("foodOrderPublishIntermediate")` channel and a `READY` status on the [hotspot=foodOrder file=0]`@Outgoing("foodOrderPublish")` channel to Kafka over MicroProfile Reactive Messaging channels.

*Building the Bar microservice*

//bar
[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `BarResource` class.#
`bar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/bar/BarResource.java`
----
BarResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/bar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/bar/BarResource.java[]
----

If the order is a drink, `Bar` service receives an order on the [hotspot=bevOrderConsume file=1]`@Incoming("bevOrderConsume")` channel, processes it in [hotspot=initBevOrder file=1]`initBeverageOrder()` method and sends back an `IN_PROGRESS` status on the [hotspot=bevOrderPublishInter file=1]`@Outgoing("bevOrderPublishInter")` channel and a `READY` status on the [hotspot=bevOrder file=1]`@Outgoing("beverageOrderPublish")` channel to Kafka over MicroProfile Reactive Messaging channels.

*Building the ServingWindow microservice*

//servingWindow
[role="code_command hotspot file=2", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `ServingWindowResource` class.#
`servingWindow/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/servingWindow/ServingWindowResource.java`
----
ServingWindowResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/servingWindow/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/servingWindow/ServingWindowResource.java[]
----

The `ServingWindow` microservice receives a `Ready` order from the `Bar` and `Kitchen` microservices over the [hotspot=addReadyOrder file=2]`@Incoming("orderReady")` channel.
Once the order is served, it's marked as `COMPLETED` and the status is sent across to the `Order` microservice using the [hotspot=sendCompletedOrder file=2]`@Outgoing("completedOrder")` channel.


*Building the Status microservice*

//status
[role="code_command hotspot file=3", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `StatusResource` class.#
`status/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/status/StatusResource.java`
----

StatusResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/status/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/status/StatusResource.java[]
----

status/microprofile-config.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/status/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

The `Status` microservice receives the message from the `Kitchen`, `Bar`, `Order`, and `ServingWindow` microservices over the [hotspot=updateStatus file=3]`@Incoming("updateStatus")` channel with its properties defined in the [hotspot=updateStatus file=4]`microprofile-config.properties`.
 

== Configuring the server

To get the service running, the Open Liberty server needs to be correctly configured.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the bar server.xml configuration file.#
`bar/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----
server.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/bar/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

Configure the server to enable MicroProfile Reactive Messaging by adding [hotspot=featureMP file=0]`mpReactiveMessaging-1.0` feature element to the [hotspot file=0]`server.xml`.

The rest of the microservices have [hotspot file=0]`server.xml` already configured.

== Building the application

You will build and run the `Order`, `Kitchen`, `Bar`, `ServingWindow`, `Status`, and `OpenLibertyCafe` microservices in Docker containers.

Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command line in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
```

Run the following command to download or update the `open-liberty` docker image to latest.
[role='command']
```
docker pull open-liberty
```

Run the following commands to containerize the microservices:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t kitchen:1.0-SNAPSHOT kitchen/.
docker build -t bar:1.0-SNAPSHOT bar/.
docker build -t servingwindow:1.0-SNAPSHOT servingWindow/.
docker build -t order:1.0-SNAPSHOT order/.
docker build -t status:1.0-SNAPSHOT status/.
docker build -t openlibertycafe:1.0-SNAPSHOT openLibertyCafe/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

[role='command']
```
.\scripts\startContainers.bat
```

== Trying the application

Once the application is up and running, you can access the application by making requests to the `OpenLibertyCafe` endpoint using OpenAPI.

The services take some time to become available. Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui[^] URL.

*Place Orders*

Make a `POST` request to the `/api/orders` endpoint. To make this request, expand the `POST` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out button*. Copy the following example input into the text box, and then click the `Execute` button. The `POST` request adds a new `food` and `beverage` Order.

[source, role='command']
----
{
  "tableId": "1",
  "foodList": [
    "burger"
  ],
  "beverageList": [
    "coke"
  ]
}
----

*Check IN_PROGRESS Order Status*

Next, make a `GET` request to the `/api/status` endpoint. To make this request, expand the `GET` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out button*, and then click the `Execute` button. The `GET` request returns information about the Orders. The response should show that the Orders have an `IN_PROGRESS` status. Just in case if you see a `NEW` status then wait for a couple of seconds and click the `Execute` button again.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderId": "0001",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderId": "0002",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

*Check READY Order Status*

Click `Execute` again and you will see the response with a `READY` status. Just in case if you see an `IN_PROGRESS` status then wait for a couple of seconds and click the `Execute` button again.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderId": "0001",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderId": "0002",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

*Complete an Order*

Make a `POST` request to the `/api/servingWindow/{orderId}` endpoint to complete an order. Expand the `POST` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out* button. Copy the following orderId into the text box, and then click the `Execute` button.
 
[source, role='command']
----

0002
----

The status for the `orderId 0002` is changed from `READY` to `COMPLETED` and the updated status is cascaded to the `Status` microservice.

Then, make a `GET` request to the `/api/status` endpoint again and verify that the status for the order with an `orderId` of `0002` is now labelled as `COMPLETED`.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderId": "0001",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderId": "0002",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

== Tearing down the environment

Finally, use the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--
